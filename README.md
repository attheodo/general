Euruko 2013 public repository
=======

A place for publicly tracking ideas, volunteering, brainstorming and public documentation to help with organizing the Euruko2013 conference in Athens

Organization
========

Euruko2013 has 2 GitHub repositories. This one is public and will be used by the community as a whole for suggestions, proposals and offers of help.

The private repository is available to the committee members and is private only because we want to have some surprises in store for Euruko 2013 attendees.

How to go about contributing
========

Use [Issues](https://github.com/euruko2013/general/issues) to post suggestions and volunteer for tasks.

Periodically we will request proposals for some things. You should use post a pull request with your proposal and the pull request discussion board will be where we vote and discuss the proposal (yes, yes this is not our idea, kudos to the Euruko 2012 for staging the CFPs this way)

Rules and Guidelines.
========

There is One Rule at the moment

    Refusal and negative comments without an alternate proposal are not acceptable. 
    Αρνήσεις χωρίς αντιπρόταση δε γίνονται δεκτές.
