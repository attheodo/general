The Give-Us-A-Logo Call
=====

Euruko 2013 needs a logo!

So, clone this repository, add a subdirectory to the logo directory with the name of your logo e.g. super-cool-logo-by-mitsos and sent us a pull request.

We prefer .svg and a .png export of it.

What are you going to do with it
=====
The logo design with the most votes will be used as the basis for the Euruko 2013 Athens logo.

What we mean with "basis" is that the team that will design the website, the t-shirts etc. will have the option of changing the logo to maybe color coordinate it or some such design-y magic.
